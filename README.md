## 📈 The Project

---

This repository explores the **Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)** model for DESE71019 Modelling and Simulation module.

It combines mathematical analysis using continuous replicator dynamics and particle-based simulation to compare behaviours with stochastic, real-world dynamics. The project examines non-dimensionalisation, fixed points, stability, and phase-space behaviour, bifurcation, and more.

When running the code, please `Enable Dynamics` in Wolfram Mathematica for the simulation.

## 🧟 The Value

---

From an evolutionary perspective, the project shows how adjusting a populations’s advantage over its prey affect the population. Interestingly, in 3 species cyclic pattern, by becoming more effective at eliminating its prey, a species indirectly strengthens the population that hunts it, shifting coexistence in favour of its predator.

This framework even extends to more imaginative scenarios, such as `Human - Zombie - Third Species` systems. What if there was a third “resistants” or “mutants” population that can cure zombies but can be lose immunity by human? Or “new carrier” status that can infect zombies, but cured by human? This opens the door to richer, more biologically and socially inspired dynamics.
